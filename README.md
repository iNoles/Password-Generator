# Strong Password Generator

This Python script generates strong passwords with customizable lengths. It utilizes a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to create secure passwords.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iNoles/Password-Generator.git

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd Password-Generator
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```

4. You will be prompted to enter the desired length of the password. If you don't provide any input, a password of length 12 will be generated by default.

5. Once the password is generated, it will be displayed on the screen.

## Example

Enter the length of the password (default is 12):
